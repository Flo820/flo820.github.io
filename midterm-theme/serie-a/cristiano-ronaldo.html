                <h2>Scoring Machine</h2>
                <p>Cristiano Ronaldo is definitely one of the greatest to ever touch a football. It would be crazy to say not so as Cristiano contests for the gtreatest in history along with Lionel Messi. Cristiano Ronaldo is just what the title depicts, a scoring machine. If you want a forward that you could depend on to score that man is Ronaldo. Ronalod is a threat through the ground as well as through the air. This is what makes Ronaldo and Messi different. Ronaldo is the ones who will keep on scoring and scoring while Messi is the dribbler, the playmaker. Don't get me wrong, each can do what the other can do one has better skill in one area than the other.</p>

                    <h2>World Records</h2>
                    <p>Like Messi, Ronaldo is also a record breaker machine. Some of his accomplishments are, the most Baloon d'Or awards at 5 shared with Lionel Messi, most appearances for top 3 candidates for the Ballon d'Or awards shared with Lionel Messi, had the most points for the Ballon d'Or awards voting with 946 points in 2017, had the biggest winning margin in voting points for the Ballon d'Or by 429 poinnts in 2016, only player to score in every Champions League group stage match, only player to score 15 or more goals in the champions league calendar year, only player to finish top goal scorer in the champions league for 6 consecutive seasons, first player to score 100 goals in the UEFA Champions League, first player to win all four PFA and FWA wards. He has many more achievements like Messi but the list would be going on and on.</p>
