            <h2>El Chucky</h2>
            <p>Hirving Lozano is the pride of every Mexican when it comes to football. I am Mexican myself and we love this sport. Loving the sport comes with having high expectations for our international team as well. We have had our up and downs thoughout history but we have finally found that wonderkid who may spark out international team to new heights. That wonderkid is Hirving Lozano.</p>

            <p>My father being a fan of Club Deportivo Chivas from the Liga MX (Mexican Football league) so I myself followed the league and got to see Hirving Lozano when he started his career at C.F Pachuca. Lozano put himself on the spotlight almost from the very start. He was what you wanted in a winger, fast, clinical finisher and the ability to dribble through the defense. You knew that he was going to have a successful career in his near future and he went and did just that.</p>

                <p>One of the most memorable moment recently was when Lozano on a counter attack scores the goal that aids Mexico to beat Germany in the 2018 Russia World Cup. This was such an amazing feeling be able to beat the titans in Germany, the reigning World Champions who always ended up beating us, lost to us in the most important tourney in football history. It was even better when we were placed in the group of death as some mentioned it where Mexico would not make it out of groups, but instead germany did not and Mexico did.</p>
                
                <p>When we talk about the any players out there that are considered high calibre and which contend at the best leagues in the world, Lozano obviously is not considered the best player in the world, or one of the best players in the world. He just recently landed a spot at Napoli in the Serie A league (Italian league) which is really great, but he is still young. Age 24 and his career is already more successful than most football players caeers and he has some accolades to back this up with. Lozano was able to lead Pachuca to a 2016 league title, a CONCACAF Champions League title, lead the Mexican under 20 CONCACAF title, CONCACAF Men's Olympics qualyfing championship, and was also able to win the league championship with PSV in 2018.</p>
