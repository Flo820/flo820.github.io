            <h2>World Class Wonderkid</h2>
            <p>With the end of an era of all Football coming to its final moments in Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo many look into the future on who may be able to fill in those shoes. The truth is that probably no one will ever be able to fill the gap that Ronaldo and Messi will leave but Kylian Mbpappe is the cloest we are seeing to that. The French Wonderkid is having the start of a career everyone dreams of. Its what your career would look like if you started a new career on the FIFA video game. He has everything that it takes to become a world class calibre football player, not that he already isn't. He has the speed, agility, dribbling, shooting and clinical finishing.</p>

            <p>Everyone saw the spark that this kid had, the fire that he had to keep on going when he was playing for Monaco. Everyone realized he had what it took to be world class, the potential to become the best in the world. He made his debut for Monaco at the early age of 16. He was already playing against the worlds best at such a young age. Then PSG made a move to get Mbappe as they started to rise into the international scene as a threat to all the other top teams.</p>

            <p>When we say that the start of Kylian Mbappes career is like the start of a video game we truly mean it. Being among the best at just the age of 17 is already a spectacular feat on its own then joining one of the biggest clubs at the age of 18 is incredible and is something everyone dreams of. Then his most impressive feat to date. Kylian Mbappe at just the age of 18 has achieved what even Messi and Ronaldo have not. That is winning the World Cup. Overall, he still has a lot of room for him to be able to grow which will only deem for more greatness in the future.</p>
