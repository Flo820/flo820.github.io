            <h2>Brazilian Magician</h2>
            <p>Neymar has been at the top of the game for a while and it has not been because of luck. There is a reason he managed to become the most expesnive transfer in the history of football with an astonishing $263 million transfer fee from Barcelona to PSG. Neymar was having the time of his life at Barcelona and his career was at a very high peak as he shared the attack with Luis Suarez and Lionel Messi himself. They were dubbed the greatest trio to have ever played football as they managed to bring home the trebal by winning both competiton championships in Spain and the UEFA Champions League Cup when they defeated then the tough opposition of Juventus.</p>
            <p>Prior to leaving Barceloa Neymar reached a peak that we did not expect out of him. Lonel Messi had an injury that season and it was up to Neymar and Luis Suarez to step up for Barcelonas attacking force and Neymar did just that. During that time Neymar was theo obvious best player at the top. No one came even close to how spectacular Neymar was playing. Everyone talked about how Barcelona was all about Messi, that Neymar was living in Messi's shadow but he went out there and pro ved them wrong. He showed that he was as much of an asset to Barcelona's attack as Messi was.</p>

                <p>Even with how well Neymar played alongside Luis Suarez and Messi he ended up leaving the club to go try his luck at PSG. Many said that Neymar left for money, others said that he left to get out of Messi's shadow. Regardless he left making history. Neymar has not been able to shine internationally as he would wish he did with PSG but he still remains at the top of the chain in terms of the greatest football players currently and he is still in his prime, the future holds greatness for him especially now that Messi had demanded Barcelona to bid a transfer for Neymar to return to the Camp Nou. Greatness is what awaits Neymar if this transfer occurs.</p>
