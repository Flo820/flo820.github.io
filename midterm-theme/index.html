        <p>I have decided to make my theme about The Beautiful Game which has been dubbed to Football (or soccer for us in the United States) as it is my favorite sport. More specifically the theme is about my most favorite players of football so do not get this list confused on the top 7 players currently even though these are some of the best football players out there. From a young age I started to follow the sport because of my dad. My dad became a huge football fan and always watched Club Deportivo Chivas games on the TV. I slowly got myself into the sport and became a fan of Club Deportivo Chivas as well. I slowly then got into playing football myself when my father bought me a football for my birthday. I started to play with my cousins which I lived with during that time and it shortly became a regular routine to go play football outside whenever we could. I wanted to pursue football but that came to an end when I broke my ankle in 6th grade. I had chances of my ankle would stop growing which really made me upset at that time. I was out for a year from that point and after that my ankle was never really the same. I had pain on it whenever I tried to play for long periods of time. But it was a blessing to a degree as it turned my focused towards technology and here I am purseing a job in Computer Sceince or It.</p>
