            <h2>Goalkeeper?</h2>
            <p>When it comes to the sport of football, goalkeepers are very underrated in terms of popularity and how much rating people give them overall to their contribution. But the sport has evolved towards a more team based game in which goalkeepers are being recognized more as an important asset of the game. Do not get me wrong as goalkeepers have always been one of the most important aspects of football if not the most important one. But the rocognization is increasing as time passes towards goalkeepers. The game has transformed towards a game where goalkeepers are more involved thus they need to be prepared in order to save the ball. Good teams are more team based and passed orientaded instead of having individuallity among their playstyle. This causes for more shooting attempts or chances from many directions. Add individual skills to this asset and it becomes extremely difficult to defend a net as a goalkeeper. If you have an attacking force that can work together and mesh all these skills you will have a successful team at front.</p>

                <p>David De Gea became one of my favorite goalkeepers and one of the best to defend a net from many peoples perspectives as well. As Manchester United continue on with their struggles, David De Gea continues to shine with his amazing saves. His quick reflexes have saved Manchester United in many instances, not only with his hands but with his legs as well. This is one of the key factors that sets him apart from every other goalkeeper out there. Not many are confortable using their legs to save a goal. Many think that his talent is being wasted at Manchester United but he has stayed for many years and continues to defend the Red Devils net.</p>
