                <h2>Egyptian Messi</h2>
                <p>Mohamed Salah has had an interesting football career in my opinion. He was never really in the spotlight. He was off and about teams trying to find his place in a team to be succesful. Then Liverpool F.C. come around with a new manager, it was a new fresh start for Liverpool. Jurgen Klopp in my opinion one of the best managers in football currently. He helped Dortmund find success and he did the same with liverpool. Along side liverpool, Mo Salah was phenomenal. Salah quickly became one of the best football players in the planet along with a boilstering Liverpool squad which was only getting better and better. Mo Salah quickly had great chemistry with Sadio Mane and Roberto Firmino who which Salah shares the attacking front force for Liverpool. Salah was a goal scoring machine to say the least. He looked like Messi thus dubbed the Egyptian Messi and he was playing at such a high level in the Premier League which is considered the hardest league to play Football in.</p>

                <p>Mo Salah was reallly amazing for Liverpool that he broke the record for the most goals scored in a season, over the likes of Cristiano Ronaldo back when he was plaiying for Manchester United. Salah managed to score 32 goals, 32 goals in the Premier League. Liverpool reached the Champions League final but unfortunately lost in the grand final against Real Madrid but this past season they yet again reached the Champions League final and won it this time around. Liverpool now stands as one of the best teams in the world if not the best team in the world right now.</p>
