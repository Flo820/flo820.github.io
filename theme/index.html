        <h1>Nissan GTR</h1>

        <p>The theme for this assignment will be about the Nissan GTR sports car. From a young age I became interested in cars in general. Obviously, as a kid everyone has a dream of achieving something big and one of those dreams for me was being able to afford a sports car from a big brand which some include the likes of Ferrari, Lamborgini Bugatti, Koenigsegg, etc. But Regardless of all the sports cars out there,the Nissan GTR is my favorite car just edging over the McLaren P1.</p>

        <p>The Nissan GTR is probably one of the favorite cars for any car enthusiast. Perhaps one of the most storied as well. The Nissan GTR is a sports car produced from obviously, Nissan which comes in succession from the Nissan Skyline GTR family. The Nissan GTR has had such a great performance around the world that it has been dubbed Godzilla as it has the capability of taking down high end luxury sports cars such as ferrari and lamborgini. It is truly a marvelous car with its top speed that kicks in at 6th gear. The Nissan GTR contends for my favorite sports car and this will possibly be my first sports car. hopefully if I am able to do so in the future.</p>
